# Create New Rule

This rule creates new cursor rules in the `.cursor/rules` directory with the `.mdc` file extension.

## When creating a rule

```cursor
when: user asks to "create a rule {for|that|to} {purpose}" or "make a rule {for|that|to} {purpose}" or "add a rule {for|that|to} {purpose}" or "new rule {for|that|to} {purpose}"
do:
  - set filename to kebab_case(purpose) + ".mdc"
  - create file at ".cursor/rules/" + filename
  - write the following template to the file:
    ```
    ---
    name: {capitalize(purpose)}
    description:
    ---

    # {capitalize(purpose)}

    ## When

    ```cursor
    when:
    do:
      -
    ```

    ## Example

    ```
    ```
    ```
  - position cursor after "description: "
```

## Example

When you ask "create a rule for formatting code", it will create a new rule file at `.cursor/rules/formatting-code.mdc` with a template ready for you to fill in.
