# Git Cat Rule

## Description
This rule automatically appends "| cat" to any git commands to prevent paging issues in the terminal.

## Rule
When executing git commands in the terminal, append "| cat" to prevent paging issues that can cause the terminal to hang or display content improperly.

## Examples
- Original: `git log`
- Modified: `git log | cat`
- Original: `git diff`
- Modified: `git diff | cat`
- Original: `git show`
- Modified: `git show | cat`

## Implementation
When using the `run_terminal_cmd` tool with git commands, automatically append "| cat" to the command if it's a git command that might produce paginated output.

```typescript
// Check if the command is a git command that might produce paginated output
if (command.startsWith('git ') && 
    (command.includes('log') || 
     command.includes('diff') || 
     command.includes('show') || 
     command.includes('blame'))) {
  
  // Only append "| cat" if it's not already there
  if (!command.includes('| cat')) {
    command = command + ' | cat';
  }
}
```

## Notes
This rule helps prevent issues with terminal commands that use pagers like `less` which can cause problems in automated environments or when using AI assistants.
