# Implementation Plan: Adding a New Field to Task Management Application

This document outlines the step-by-step approach for adding a new field to the existing Task Management Application.

## Progress Tracking

1. Create a file `update_process.md` at the root of the project to track progress.
2. Document each step as it is completed with timestamps.
3. Delete the tracking file once all changes have been verified.

## Enum Type Creation (For enum fields)

If the new field is an enum type, create separate enum declarations for each architectural layer to maintain proper separation of concerns.

1. **Create Presentation Layer Enum (DTO Layer)**
   - Create a new enum in the `com.cursor.automation.model.dto` package
   - Define all enum values needed for the presentation layer
   - Document with appropriate comments

2. **Create Service Layer Enum**
   - Create a new enum in the `com.cursor.automation.service.model` package
   - Define all enum values needed for the service layer
   - Document with appropriate comments

3. **Create Data Access Layer Enum**
   - Create a new enum in the `com.cursor.automation.dal.model` package
   - Define all enum values needed for the data access layer
   - Document with appropriate comments

4. **Create Enum Type Mapper**
   - Create a mapper utility class in the `com.cursor.automation.mapper` package to convert between enum types
   - Implement conversion methods between all enum types
   - Document with appropriate comments

## Model Updates

1. **Update TaskDTO**
   - Add the new field to the DTO class with appropriate type (use DTO layer enum if applicable)
   - Add getters and setters
   - Update constructors as needed
   - Update equals and hashCode methods if present

2. **Update TaskServiceModel**
   - Add the new field to the service model class with appropriate type (use service layer enum if applicable)
   - Add getters and setters
   - Update constructors as needed
   - Update equals and hashCode methods if present

3. **Update TaskEntity**
   - Add the new field to the entity class with appropriate type (use data access layer enum if applicable)
   - Add getters and setters
   - Update constructors as needed
   - Update equals and hashCode methods if present

## Mapper Updates

1. **Update TaskDTOMapper**
   - Update the toServiceModel method to include mapping the new field
   - Update the toDTO method to include mapping the new field
   - For enum fields, use the dedicated enum mapper to convert between types
   - Update any other affected methods (e.g., toDTOList)

2. **Update TaskEntityMapper**
   - Update the toServiceModel method to include mapping the new field
   - Update the toEntity method to include mapping the new field
   - For enum fields, use the dedicated enum mapper to convert between types
   - Update any other affected methods (e.g., toServiceModelList)

## Factory Updates

1. **Update TaskFactory**
   - Update existing factory methods to set the new field
   - Add new factory methods with the new field as a parameter if needed
   - Ensure appropriate layer-specific types are used (e.g., service layer enums for service models)

## UI Updates

1. **Update WorkflowDemo**
   - Update the UI to collect input for the new field
   - Update the display of tasks to show the new field
   - For enum fields, add a prompt method to select valid values
   - Handle validation for the new field

## Test Updates

1. **Update TaskServiceImplTest**
   - Add tests for the service with the new field
   - Update existing tests to include the new field
   - For enum fields, test all possible values

2. **Update Mapper Tests**
   - Update TaskDTOMapperTest to test mapping the new field
   - Update TaskEntityMapperTest to test mapping the new field
   - For enum fields, test mapping of all enum values
   - For enum fields, add tests for the dedicated enum mapper

3. **Update WorkflowDemoTest**
   - Add tests for UI handling of the new field
   - Test input and display of the new field
   - For enum fields, test selecting different values
   - Test validation of the new field

## Verification

After implementing all the changes, verify that:

1. The new field is properly stored and retrieved in all layers.
2. The application behaves correctly with the new field.
3. All tests pass, including the new tests for the new field.
4. The UI correctly collects and displays the new field.
5. For enum fields, conversions between layer-specific enums work correctly.

## Rollback Plan

If any issues are encountered during implementation or verification:

1. Revert all changes to the affected files.
2. Implement a simplified version of the feature if the original design is too complex.
3. Document any issues encountered for future reference.

## Script for Executing This Plan

```bash
# 1. Create progress tracking file
echo "# Field Implementation Progress Tracker" > update_process.md

# 2. Implement each step and document in the tracking file
# (Manually execute and verify each step)

# 3. Run tests to verify changes
mvn test

# 4. If all tests pass, the implementation is complete
# Delete the tracking file when done
rm update_process.md
```
